## 📌 Project Information

- **Division:** D7  
- **Group:** Group 09D7  
- **Project No:** AAI-32  
- **Problem Statement:** Multi-Agent Manufacturing System  

---

## 🚀 Overview

The **Multi-Agent Manufacturing System** is a web-based AI platform where multiple intelligent agents collaborate to solve manufacturing-related tasks such as:

✔ Supplier sourcing  
✔ Cost comparison  
✔ Data analysis  
✔ Report generation  

Instead of using a single AI model, this system uses **specialized agents** with clearly defined roles, enabling modular, scalable, and realistic AI workflows.

---

## 🧠 System Architecture

The system consists of the following agents:

| Agent | Role |
|------|------|
| **Coordinator Agent** | Manages workflow & task routing |
| **Researcher Agent** | Collects manufacturing/supplier data |
| **Analyst Agent** *(optional)* | Evaluates and compares options |
| **Writer Agent** | Generates structured reports |
